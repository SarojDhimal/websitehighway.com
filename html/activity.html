                <p class="card-text">
                    In the last quarter of the last fiscal year, the ministry had allocated a budget of Rs305.9 million for Covid-19 Action Plan. The provincial hospital received Rs105.7 million, according to the annual report of the provincial government.

The government has announced a budget of Rs1.5 billion for Covid-19 centric programme this fiscal year. As per the plan, 200 isolation beds, 40 ICU beds and 20 ventilators were to be set up in the provincial hospital. Likewise, 50 isolation beds, 10 ICU beds and five ventilators were planned for each district hospital.

Officials at the provincial hospital say owing to the lack of funds, the hospital is struggling to even pay the health workers, let alone clear the payment of medical equipment.

Soon after its formation in 2018, the Karnali government had prioritised a specialist service expansion programme considering the shortage of health workers and other employees in the health institutions in the province.

As many as 58 employees, including two doctors, were appointed in the provincial hospital on contract basis. But they have not been getting their salary. The concerned employees have warned of halting the health services if their outstanding salary is not paid by March 13.

Khadka said that the hospital had asked the government to release Rs20 million to pay the employees for the current fiscal year. But the government, according to him, has issued only Rs5 million so far.

“We released the staff salary up to Paush (mid-January). The hospital does not have the wherewithal to pay them now,” said Khadka.

The provincial hospital has 325 posts and 86 of them are permanent positions. The facility currently has 268 staff members.

Khadka said the health services in the hospital would come to a halt without the doctors and other employees appointed on contract basis.

Social Development Minister Dal Rawal also said that he had already instructed the secretary at the ministry to proceed with the necessary process to release the funds to the provincial hospital.

Loknath Paudel, the secretary at the ministry, however, claimed that the provincial government had already released the funds.

“The funds have already been released. I am currently in Kathmandu right now. If there is a problem, I will take the initiative to solve the issue after I return,” Paudel said over the phone.


 so ,we are collecting funds to supports the child health and safety practise.</p>

                    `` The World Health Organisation (hereafter WHO) has devised a plan significantly improve the health of the people residing in Karnali Province, Nepal. For this purpose, a press conference in Birendranagar, Surkhet district was convened during which information was shared with the public regarding WHO’s ongoing works. In a statement, WHO Nepal Chief Dr Rajesh Pandey explained WHO was doing the special groundwork to improve the situation of public health in the province.  He elaborated that they [the WHO] would put interventions in line with the action plan of the province and added that they had come to Surkhet to take stock of vaccination, availability of health materials and appliances and future strategies of the province as the province health is comparatively weaker than other provinces. “The WHO has its belief that citizens belonging to all groups should be healthy. We are ready to join hands to provide quality health services to the people here”, Dr Pandey said, adding, “It would be easier for us to work only after we access data-based reports from federal and province governments mapping health status and possible areas for health service interventions”. The WHO has been closely observing the health status of the people of Karnali province and will help improve the health situation of the province people in coming days, he added. The health status of the people residing in Karnali province has been closely monitored by the WHO, in order to help the health situation of the people shortly after, which would also benefit minorities to a great extent. Karnali Province Chief Minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi stated that the WHO already started their roll out by delivering 175 sets of oxygen concentrators to the province. ``

                        `` Malnutrition has been a long-standing problem in Karnali mainly due to food scarcity and shortage of nutritious foods. According to the Provincial Health Directorate in Surkhet, the majority of people in Karnali are deprived of nutritious foods.

            “Many people eat almost the same food every day. The local residents have to struggle to manage two square meals a day. Children are the most affected by malnutrition,” said Mankumari Gurung, the senior nursing officer at the directorate. According to her, only 29.5 percent of Karnali residents consume a variety of food.
            
            Some local units in Karnali have launched campaigns to promote local food consumption and consumption of a variety of nutritious food. Khandachakra Municipality in Kalikot has launched a local food promotion campaign in all 11 wards. According to Rabindra Sejuwal, the health unit chief of the local body, the municipality has allocated Rs 4.7 million for the nutrition programme.
